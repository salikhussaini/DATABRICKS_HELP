2.3 Using PySpark SQL & Lakehouse Tables

* Interoperability between DataFrame and SQL
* Temporary views, managed vs external tables
* Introduction to Delta constraints (PRIMARY KEY, GENERATED ALWAYS AS)

Here’s an expanded version of **Module 3: Building Modern DLT Pipelines** tailored for a **Data Engineer developing in Databricks**, incorporating hands-on best practices and deeper coverage for each submodule:

### **Module 3: Building Modern DLT Pipelines**

#### **3.1 DLT Pipeline Development**

**Objective:** Learn the foundational syntax and semantics of defining and managing Delta Live Tables (DLT) in Python and SQL.

* **DLT Table Declarations**

  * `@dlt.table` vs `@dlt.view`: when to use each
  * Managing dependencies between tables (chaining DLT definitions)
  * Materialized vs streaming views

* **Data Ingestion with DLT**

  * `dlt.read()` and `dlt.read_stream()` usage
  * Sourcing from multiple formats: Delta, JSON, CSV, Parquet, AutoLoader

* **Python vs SQL DLT Syntax**

  * Best practices for readability and modularity
  * When to use SQL for simplicity and Python for complex logic

* **Data Quality with Expectations**

  * `dlt.expect()`, `dlt.expect_or_fail()`, `dlt.enforce()`
  * Writing reusable quality rules
  * Logging failures and managing bad records
  * Integration with data observability tools

* **Hands-on Lab:**
  Build a DLT pipeline that ingests streaming JSON data, transforms it with business rules, and enforces data quality constraints.

---

#### **3.2 Parameterization and Workflow Configuration**

**Objective:** Enable dynamic, reusable, and well-orchestrated pipelines through configurations and dependencies.

* **Pipeline Configuration Parameters**

  * Creating and accessing parameters via `dlt.config.get()`
  * Parameterizing source paths, table names, thresholds

* **Workflow Orchestration in DLT**

  * Declarative dependencies using `@dlt.table` and upstream chaining
  * Controlling execution order without DAGs
  * Managing joins between live and static datasets
  * Handling late-arriving data or slowly changing dimensions (SCDs)

* **Advanced Techniques**

  * Multi-layer architecture: Bronze, Silver, Gold
  * Dynamically toggling pipeline behaviors using flags

* **Hands-on Lab:**
  Build a parameterized multi-layer pipeline with quality checks and runtime toggles for streaming vs batch mode.

---

#### **3.3 CI/CD & Workflow Automation**

**Objective:** Integrate DLT pipelines into version control and deployment workflows for production reliability.

* **Source Control with Databricks Repos**

  * Branching strategies and best practices
  * Folder structure for DLT projects
  * Managing notebooks vs `.py` files

* **Workflow Automation**

  * Creating and scheduling DLT pipelines via Databricks Workflows
  * Triggering pipelines via REST APIs or job dependencies
  * Using Databricks CLI and `databricks-cicd-tools`

* **Testing & Mocking**

  * Writing unit tests for DLT logic using `pytest`
  * Mocking `dlt.read()` in test environments
  * Validating expectations using test data

* **Deployment Automation**

  * Integrating with CI tools: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI/CD
  * Promoting pipelines across dev, staging, prod
