Course Objective:
Equip data engineers with the skills to build production-grade, scalable, and secure ETL pipelines using PySpark and Delta Live Tables within Databricks. Emphasis will be on real-time processing, quality enforcement, governance, and deployment automation.

Module 1: Foundations of Databricks and Delta Lake
1.1 Databricks Ecosystem Overview

* Unified analytics platform components (Unity Catalog, Jobs, MLflow, Workflows)
* Navigating Databricks Repos and Version Control integration
* Cluster setup: job vs all-purpose vs serverless

1.2 Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables (DLT) Architecture

* Delta Lake capabilities: ACID transactions, schema enforcement
* DLT vs traditional ETL approaches
* Development workflows: Development vs Production modes
* Bronze, Silver, Gold patterns in medallion architecture

Module 2: Mastering PySpark in Databricks
2.1 Core PySpark Operations

* DataFrames: creation, schema inference, basic transformations
* Columnar operations vs row-based (RDDs) — when and why

2.2 Efficient DataFrame Transformations

* join types and anti-joins
* broadcast joins and optimization
* withColumn, selectExpr, when/otherwise

2.3 Using PySpark SQL & Lakehouse Tables

* Interoperability between DataFrame and SQL
* Temporary views, managed vs external tables
* Introduction to Delta constraints (PRIMARY KEY, GENERATED ALWAYS AS)

Module 3: Building Modern DLT Pipelines
3.1 DLT Pipeline Development

* dlt.read, dlt.read\_stream, and table declarations
* SQL vs Python DLT syntax
* Expectations: enforce(), expect(), expect\_or\_fail()

3.2 Parameterization and Workflow Configuration

* Using pipeline configuration parameters
* Declarative orchestration using DLT flows and dependencies

3.3 CI/CD & Workflow Automation

* Integrating DLT with Repos and Workflows
* Testing pipelines and mocking inputs

Module 4: Data Quality & Observability
4.1 Data Validation with Expectations

* Common validation patterns: null checks, range checks, lookup validation
* Monitoring data quality metrics

4.2 Monitoring & Debugging

* Pipeline event logs
* Alerting and notifications
* Databricks observability features: lineage and audit

Module 5: Advanced PySpark for Transformations
5.1 Using Window Functions and Advanced Aggregations

* rank(), row\_number(), rolling aggregations
* multi-level aggregations (groupBy on multiple columns)

5.2 PySpark UDFs and Pandas UDFs

* Performance trade-offs
* Using pandas\_udf for vectorized transformations

5.3 Nested and Semi-Structured Data

* Working with arrays, structs, JSON
* Exploding nested fields, flattening logic

Module 6: Performance Optimization in DLT
6.1 Delta Table Optimization Techniques

* Z-Ordering and clustering strategies
* OPTIMIZE, VACUUM, auto-compaction
* Managing schema evolution with mergeSchema and ALTER TABLE

6.2 Spark and DLT Performance Tuning

* Shuffle partitions, caching, broadcast hints
* DLT pipeline performance profiling

Module 7: Streaming Pipelines in DLT
7.1 Structured Streaming Concepts

* Micro-batch vs continuous processing
* Watermarking and event-time handling

7.2 Real-Time Ingestion and Transformation

* Using read\_stream, write\_stream in DLT
* Aggregations and late-arriving data
* Fault tolerance and state management

Module 8: Data Governance with Unity Catalog
8.1 Metadata Management

* Unity Catalog overview and design
* Managing catalogs, schemas, and tables

8.2 Access Control and Security

* Row-level and column-level security
* Tokenization, masking, and audit trails
* Compliance: GDPR, HIPAA considerations

Module 9: Real-World Use Cases and Project Work
9.1 Case Studies

* Customer 360 ingestion and deduplication
* Real-time healthcare claim stream cleaning
* IoT time-series transformation with watermarks

9.2 Capstone Project

* Design and deploy an end-to-end DLT pipeline (Bronze → Gold)
* Integrate streaming and batch data
* Apply quality rules, performance tuning, monitoring

Module 10: Deployment and Operational Excellence
10.1 CI/CD and Deployment Pipelines

* Infrastructure as code (Terraform basics with DLT)
* GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for deployment
* Using Feature Store and MLflow for model pipelines

10.2 Troubleshooting and Support Playbooks

* Diagnosing slow jobs via Spark UI and Ganglia
* Recovering failed pipelines
* Maintenance patterns for data tables

Optional Add-On: Certification and Interview Preparation

* Sample certification questions (Databricks Data Engineer Associate & Professional)
* Interview questions on PySpark, DLT, performance tuning, real-time processing
