### **Tutorial: Building Your First Delta Live Table (DLT) Pipeline**

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building your first **Delta Live Table (DLT)** pipeline in **Databricks**, which is designed for handling data workflows with reliable and scalable data transformation and ingestion. We'll go through the core concepts and provide practical examples of how to build a pipeline using **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** tables for data ingestion, transformation, and aggregation.

#### **3.1 Setting Up Your First DLT Pipeline**

##### **Understanding the DLT Pipeline Structure**

A **Delta Live Table (DLT)** pipeline consists of multiple steps where data is ingested, transformed, and loaded into tables across different layers of a data pipeline. The pipeline structure typically follows the **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** architecture:

1. **Bronze Tables**: Store raw, untransformed data. Data in the Bronze layer is ingested from sources like log files, databases, or external APIs.
2. **Silver Tables**: Store cleansed and enriched data. Here, you perform transformations such as data cleaning, normalization, and standardization.
3. **Gold Tables**: Store aggregated and business-level data. The data here is ready for reporting, analysis, and business decision-making.

In Databricks, the pipeline uses **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** to manage data in these layers and automate transformations.

##### **Creating a Bronze Table for Raw Data Ingestion**

In the **Bronze layer**, we ingest raw data without any transformations. Typically, this data comes from external sources in formats such as CSV, JSON, or Parquet. Below is an example of creating a Bronze table in Databricks:

```python
import dlt
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

@dlt.table
def bronze_table():
    # Load raw data into the table
    raw_data = dlt.read("raw_data_path")
    
    # Optionally, define the schema, perform minimal transformation
    raw_data = raw_data.withColumn("ingestion_time", F.current_timestamp())
    
    return raw_data
```

Here, the **`dlt.read()`** function loads the raw data, and the **`@dlt.table`** decorator marks the function as creating a Delta Live Table.

##### **Defining Silver Tables for Data Cleansing and Transformation**

Once the raw data is ingested into the **Bronze table**, we can clean and transform the data to create a **Silver table**. The Silver layer may involve operations like filtering, cleaning missing values, and joining with other datasets.

```python
@dlt.table
def silver_table():
    # Load data from the Bronze table
    bronze_df = dlt.read("bronze_table")
    
    # Data cleansing: Remove rows with null values in essential columns
    clean_df = bronze_df.filter(F.col("important_column").isNotNull())
    
    # Additional transformations if necessary
    transformed_df = clean_df.withColumn("processed_timestamp", F.current_timestamp())
    
    return transformed_df
```

In this case, we use the `dlt.read()` function to reference the **Bronze table** and apply transformations such as filtering out rows with null values.

##### **Creating Gold Tables for Business-Level Aggregation and Reporting**

The **Gold table** represents data that is aggregated, enriched, and ready for business reporting. This layer might include summarizing sales data by region, calculating metrics such as averages, sums, or counts, and producing the final dataset for reporting.

```python
@dlt.table
def gold_table():
    # Load the cleansed Silver data
    silver_df = dlt.read("silver_table")
    
    # Aggregating data (example: total sales per region)
    gold_df = silver_df.groupBy("region").agg(
        F.sum("sales_amount").alias("total_sales"),
        F.avg("sales_amount").alias("average_sales")
    )
    
    return gold_df
```

In this Gold table, we perform an aggregation (summing up sales and calculating average sales) to generate the final business-level metrics.

#### **3.2 Defining DLT Tables**

##### **Using @dlt.table Decorator to Define Tables**

The `@dlt.table` decorator is used to define Delta Live Tables in Databricks. This decorator marks a function as creating a table in your pipeline, and Databricks will manage the underlying execution and orchestration of this table within your pipeline.

Here’s how you can use the `@dlt.table` decorator:

```python
@dlt.table
def example_table():
    # Define your transformations here
    df = dlt.read("input_data_path")
    return df
```

This simple function reads data and returns it as a Delta Live Table.

##### **Loading Data with dlt.read()**

In a Delta Live Table pipeline, you load data from other tables using the **`dlt.read()`** function. This allows you to reference other tables in the pipeline, whether it is the raw data (Bronze), cleansed data (Silver), or aggregated data (Gold).

Example of loading data into a Silver table:

```python
@dlt.table
def transformed_silver_table():
    # Read data from Bronze table
    bronze_data = dlt.read("bronze_table")
    
    # Apply some transformations
    transformed_data = bronze_data.filter(F.col("column_name").isNotNull())
    
    return transformed_data
```

##### **Writing Transformations in Delta Live Tables**

In the Delta Live Table pipeline, you can perform any necessary data transformations, such as filtering, grouping, or joining data, and then write it back to a Delta table.

Example of a transformation to clean and aggregate data:

```python
@dlt.table
def aggregated_gold_table():
    # Load cleaned data from Silver table
    silver_data = dlt.read("silver_table")
    
    # Aggregation: Calculate total and average sales per region
    aggregated_data = silver_data.groupBy("region").agg(
        F.sum("sales_amount").alias("total_sales"),
        F.avg("sales_amount").alias("average_sales")
    )
    
    return aggregated_data
```

#### **3.3 Scheduling and Automating Pipelines**

##### **Scheduling Your DLT Pipeline for Regular Execution**

Once you have created your Delta Live Tables pipeline, you need to set up a schedule for running the pipeline at regular intervals (e.g., daily, hourly). This is done using **Databricks Jobs**.

1. Go to your Databricks workspace.
2. Navigate to **Jobs** > **Create Job**.
3. Select the **Delta Live Tables pipeline** you’ve created.
4. Choose the scheduling options (e.g., run every 1 hour, daily at a specific time).

##### **Setting Up Automated and Incremental Data Pipelines**

Delta Live Tables support **incremental loading**, meaning that you can automate your pipeline to process only the new or changed data since the last pipeline run. You can configure your DLT pipeline to load data incrementally by specifying the **"incremental"** mode in your pipeline configuration.

Example configuration:

```python
@dlt.table
def incremental_silver_table():
    # Incrementally load new data from the Bronze table
    return dlt.read("bronze_table").filter(F.col("ingestion_time") > F.lit("2025-01-01"))
```

This will process only new data that has been ingested since a certain timestamp.

##### **Automating Pipelines Through Databricks Jobs**

To automate your Delta Live Tables pipelines, you can trigger them using **Databricks Jobs**. You can configure your pipeline to automatically run at regular intervals or in response to events. This is ideal for production environments where data needs to be ingested, transformed, and made available for business analysis continuously.

Here’s how to automate through Databricks Jobs:

1. Go to the **Jobs** tab in Databricks.
2. Create a new job and select the DLT pipeline you’ve built.
3. Set the desired schedule (e.g., hourly, daily).
4. Optionally, set up notifications for success or failure.
