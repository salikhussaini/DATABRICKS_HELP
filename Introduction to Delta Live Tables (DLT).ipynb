### **1.2 Introduction to Delta Live Tables (DLT)**

#### **What is DLT and How It Integrates with Delta Lake?**

**Delta Live Tables (DLT)** is a powerful feature in **Databricks** that allows you to create reliable and automated data pipelines for batch and streaming workloads. It integrates seamlessly with **Delta Lake**, a unified data lake storage layer that provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and data versioning. DLT leverages the power of **Delta Lake** to provide better data governance, easier data transformation, and automated pipeline orchestration.

In a typical data engineering pipeline, there is often a need to perform multiple tasks:

1. **Ingest** raw data from different sources.
2. **Cleanse** and transform the data to meet business needs.
3. **Persist** the data in a usable format for downstream analysis.

Delta Live Tables simplifies and automates this process by providing a declarative framework to define the pipeline logic, automate its execution, and ensure data quality throughout the process.

**How it integrates with Delta Lake**:

* DLT makes use of **Delta Lake’s** features like **ACID transactions** and **schema evolution**.
* DLT uses Delta tables for optimized data storage and processing.
* With DLT, all changes to the data (inserts, updates, deletes) are tracked, and users can access **historical versions** of the data using **time travel**.

#### **The Architecture and Benefits of DLT**

**Architecture:**
Delta Live Tables consists of several core components that define how your data pipeline operates:

1. **Delta Live Table Pipelines**:

   * A pipeline is a series of steps that define how data moves from raw ingestion to cleaned, transformed, and aggregated data.
   * A pipeline runs a sequence of tables and transformations as defined in your notebooks, and can process both **batch** and **streaming** data.

2. **Tables**:

   * Tables are the heart of a DLT pipeline. You define your data transformations using the `@dlt.table` decorator in Python.
   * Each table represents a **logical transformation step** and can be of three types:

     * **Bronze**: Raw ingested data (low quality).
     * **Silver**: Cleaned, transformed, and normalized data (intermediate).
     * **Gold**: Aggregated or business-level data (high quality).

3. **Pipelines**:

   * A pipeline orchestrates the flow of data between tables. Pipelines are responsible for **orchestrating transformations**, managing dependencies, and ensuring data consistency.

4. **Expectations**:

   * Expectations are rules that define the validity of data at each table stage. For example, checking if a column contains non-null values or ensuring a column’s values meet a particular range.
   * Expectations help automate **data quality checks** throughout the pipeline, ensuring that only valid data moves forward.

**Benefits of DLT**:

* **Declarative Syntax**: Define tables and transformations using simple Python decorators, making it easier to build and maintain pipelines.
* **Automatic Orchestration**: DLT automatically handles the orchestration and scheduling of your pipeline, ensuring that it runs efficiently and reliably.
* **Data Quality Assurance**: With expectations, you can enforce data validation rules at each step, automatically preventing bad data from entering the pipeline.
* **Scalability**: DLT allows you to scale to handle large volumes of data, from batch to streaming workloads, without changing your pipeline code.
* **Simplified ETL**: You don’t need to manage the infrastructure, error handling, or job scheduling manually. DLT abstracts these complexities.

#### **Key Concepts: Tables, Pipelines, and Expectations**

1. **Tables**:

   * A table in DLT represents a data processing step. You can define tables using the `@dlt.table` decorator.
   * Tables are designed to capture specific transformations of the data, whether it’s raw data ingestion (Bronze), intermediate transformations (Silver), or high-level aggregations (Gold).

   Example of defining a table:

   ```python
   @dlt.table(
       name="bronze_customer_data",
       comment="Raw customer data from various sources"
   )
   def bronze_customer_data():
       df = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv("/mnt/raw_data/customers.csv")
       return df
   ```

2. **Pipelines**:

   * A pipeline is a sequence of tables connected through dependencies. A pipeline runs in an automated, scheduled manner, processing data as per the defined transformations.
   * You define your pipeline logic in a Databricks notebook, and DLT manages its execution.

   Example of a pipeline flow:

   * **Raw data** → `bronze` table.
   * **Cleaned data** → `silver` table.
   * **Aggregated data** → `gold` table.

3. **Expectations**:

   * Expectations in DLT define rules to validate data at each table step. They ensure data quality by applying checks such as non-null values or value ranges.
   * Expectations are defined using `@dlt.expect` and can be applied to each table.

   Example of adding an expectation:

   ```python
   @dlt.expect("valid_customer_id", "customer_id IS NOT NULL")
   @dlt.table
   def validated_sales_data():
       df = dlt.read("bronze_sales_data")
       return df
   ```

#### **Overview of Managed vs Unmanaged Tables**

In Delta Live Tables, there are two types of tables based on how they are managed:

1. **Managed Tables**:

   * Delta Lake **manages** both the metadata and data storage.
   * When you create a managed table in DLT, Delta takes care of both storing and managing the data for you.
   * This is ideal for tables that are fully controlled within Databricks.

   Example of creating a managed table:

   ```python
   @dlt.table(
       name="managed_sales_data",
       comment="Managed sales data"
   )
   def managed_sales_data():
       df = dlt.read("bronze_sales_data")
       return df
   ```

2. **Unmanaged Tables**:

   * Unmanaged tables are only managed by **metadata** in Databricks, while the actual data resides in external storage locations (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage).
   * These tables are useful when the data already exists outside the Databricks environment and you want to leverage Delta Lake’s capabilities without moving the data.

   Example of creating an unmanaged table:

   ```python
   @dlt.table(
       name="unmanaged_sales_data",
       location="/mnt/external_data/sales_data",
       comment="Unmanaged sales data from external location"
   )
   def unmanaged_sales_data():
       df = dlt.read("external_sales_data")
       return df
   ```

#### **Setting Up a DLT Pipeline**

Here’s how you can set up a basic Delta Live Tables pipeline:

1. **Create a New Notebook** in Databricks.
2. **Define Your Tables** using the `@dlt.table` decorator for each step in the pipeline (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold).
3. **Validate Data** by defining **expectations** on each table.
4. **Create the Pipeline** using the Databricks UI:

   * Navigate to the **Pipelines** tab.
   * Create a new pipeline, specify the notebook you created, and configure the scheduling for automatic execution.
5. **Run the Pipeline** and monitor its execution in the Databricks UI.
