#### **5.1 PySpark Transformations**

##### **Advanced PySpark Transformations: withColumn, map, flatMap**

PySpark transformations enable data engineers to perform complex data transformations, and here we’ll explore some of the most advanced transformations.

1. **withColumn()**:
   The `withColumn()` function is used to add new columns or update existing ones in a DataFrame. It’s an essential operation in many data pipelines.

   Example: Adding a column to calculate the total price for each row.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import col

   # Adding a new column for total price
   df = df.withColumn("total_price", col("quantity") * col("price_per_unit"))
   ```

2. **map() and flatMap()**:
   The `map()` and `flatMap()` functions are typically used on RDDs but can be applied in transformations on DataFrames as well.

   * **map()** applies a function to each element of the RDD and returns a new RDD.
   * **flatMap()** works similarly but flattens the result into a single collection.

   Example:

   ```python
   rdd = df.rdd.map(lambda x: (x['id'], x['quantity'] * x['price']))
   # Using flatMap for flattening
   rdd_flat = df.rdd.flatMap(lambda x: [(x['id'], x['quantity']), (x['id'], x['price'])])
   ```

   These transformations can be used for fine-grained data manipulation in the Bronze or Silver layers of DLT pipelines.

##### **Using Window Functions for Running Totals, Ranks, etc.**

PySpark **Window functions** allow you to perform calculations across rows related to the current row within a partition. It’s essential for calculating things like running totals, ranks, and cumulative metrics.

Example: Calculating a running total of sales.

```python
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum as _sum, col

# Define window specification
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("region").orderBy("date")

# Calculate running total
df = df.withColumn("running_total", _sum("sales_amount").over(window_spec))
```

You can also use other window functions like **rank()**, **dense\_rank()**, or **row\_number()**.

##### **Advanced Aggregations with groupBy and agg**

Aggregation operations in PySpark are crucial for summarizing data. The `groupBy` function is used to group data, while `agg` allows you to perform multiple aggregations on grouped data.

Example: Aggregating sales by region and calculating both the total and average sales:

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

df_agg = df.groupBy("region").agg(
    F.sum("sales_amount").alias("total_sales"),
    F.avg("sales_amount").alias("average_sales"),
    F.max("sales_amount").alias("max_sales")
)
```

You can perform complex aggregations across multiple columns to generate business insights.

#### **5.2 PySpark UDFs (User-Defined Functions)**

##### **Introduction to UDFs in PySpark**

A **User-Defined Function (UDF)** is a way to extend PySpark by allowing you to define custom functions that are not available in the built-in PySpark functions library. UDFs are typically used when built-in functions do not cover a specific transformation you need.

Example: A custom UDF to convert text to uppercase.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from pyspark.sql.types import StringType

# Define UDF to convert text to uppercase
def to_uppercase(text):
    return text.upper()

# Register UDF
to_uppercase_udf = udf(to_uppercase, StringType())

# Apply UDF
df = df.withColumn("upper_text", to_uppercase_udf(col("text_column")))
```

##### **Creating and Registering UDFs in Databricks**

In Databricks, you can register UDFs to be used across your DLT pipeline. Here's how you register and use a UDF:

1. Create the function.
2. Register it using `udf.register()`.
3. Apply it using the `withColumn()` method.

Example of registering a UDF in Databricks:

```python
spark.udf.register("to_uppercase", to_uppercase, StringType())

# You can now use it in SQL queries
df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp_df")
spark.sql("SELECT to_uppercase(text_column) FROM temp_df")
```

##### **Performance Considerations with UDFs vs Built-in Spark Functions**

While UDFs are flexible, they can be less performant than built-in PySpark functions because they introduce serialization and function execution overhead. Whenever possible, try to use built-in PySpark functions (like `upper()` instead of a UDF for `to_uppercase()`) as they are optimized for distributed execution.

```python
# Use built-in functions instead of UDFs for better performance
df = df.withColumn("upper_text", F.upper(col("text_column")))
```

#### **5.3 Handling Complex Data Structures**

##### **Working with Nested JSON and Parquet Files**

Data in **JSON** and **Parquet** formats can often be nested, with fields containing arrays or structs. PySpark provides the necessary functions to handle and manipulate this data.

Example: Loading a nested **JSON** file and selecting nested fields.

```python
# Load nested JSON data
df = spark.read.json("path_to_json_file")

# Access nested data using dot notation
df = df.select("user.name", "user.address.city", "user.orders.items")
```

##### **Flattening Nested Data with `explode()` and `selectExpr()`**

To flatten nested structures like arrays, you can use the **`explode()`** function in PySpark. This is useful when you need to expand arrays into multiple rows.

Example: Flattening an array of items in an order:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import explode

# Flatten the array column into multiple rows
df_flattened = df.select(explode(col("orders.items")).alias("item"))
```

**`selectExpr()`** allows you to manipulate columns using SQL expressions. It is useful for more complex operations.

Example:

```python
df_flattened = df.selectExpr("user.name", "explode(orders.items) as item")
```

##### **Working with Arrays and Structs**

Arrays and structs are common complex data types in both JSON and Parquet. PySpark provides powerful functions for working with these types.

Example: Accessing elements from an array.

```python
df = df.withColumn("first_item", col("orders.items")[0])
```

Example: Accessing fields from a struct.

```python
df = df.withColumn("user_name", col("user.name"))
```

You can also use **`getItem()`** for arrays and **`getField()`** for structs if you prefer a more explicit syntax.
