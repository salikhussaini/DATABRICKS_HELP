### **Module 4: Data Quality & Validation with Delta Live Tables**

---

#### **4.1 Implementing Data Expectations**

**What are Data Expectations in Delta Live Tables (DLT)?**

Delta Live Tables (DLT) provides a built-in feature called **Expectations** that helps ensure data quality and integrity throughout the pipeline. Expectations are conditions or rules that data must meet before being loaded into a table. By using expectations, you can validate and filter data based on specific conditions.

Expectations can be applied using the `@dlt.expect` decorator in your pipeline code, which enables you to enforce business rules, data integrity checks, and other data quality requirements.

---

##### **Understanding Expectations in DLT**

Expectations are defined within the DLT pipeline to validate incoming data. Common expectations include:

* **Value validation**: Ensure data meets certain conditions (e.g., greater than zero, within a range).
* **Null validation**: Check for missing or `NULL` values.
* **Uniqueness**: Ensure no duplicates in specific columns.
* **Data type validation**: Ensure correct types for columns.

---

##### **Enforcing Data Quality Rules with Expectations**

To define expectations, use the `@dlt.expect` decorator to enforce rules on incoming data. You can apply multiple expectations to a table.

**Example: Enforcing basic validation rules**

In this example, we ensure that values in the `age` column are greater than 18, and the `user_id` is never `NULL`.

```python
import dlt

@dlt.table
@dlt.expect("age_is_valid", "age > 18")
@dlt.expect("user_id_is_not_null", "user_id IS NOT NULL")
def validated_data():
    return (
        spark.read.parquet("dbfs:/path/to/raw_data/")
    )
```

* **`@dlt.expect("age_is_valid", "age > 18")`**: Ensures that the `age` column contains values greater than 18.
* **`@dlt.expect("user_id_is_not_null", "user_id IS NOT NULL")`**: Ensures that `user_id` does not contain any `NULL` values.

---

##### **Using `@dlt.expect` for Data Validation**

The `@dlt.expect` decorator is used to define conditions that data must satisfy before it can be processed further. You can also use this feature for more complex validation logic.

**Example: Using `@dlt.expect` for a custom condition**

In this example, we apply a custom validation to ensure that the `transaction_amount` is greater than zero.

```python
@dlt.table
@dlt.expect("transaction_amount_positive", "transaction_amount > 0")
def validated_transactions():
    return (
        spark.read.parquet("dbfs:/path/to/transactions/")
    )
```

* **`@dlt.expect("transaction_amount_positive", "transaction_amount > 0")`**: Ensures that the `transaction_amount` field is greater than zero.

---

##### **Validating Custom Conditions and Advanced Expectations**

You can also apply more complex validation logic by using SQL expressions and custom conditions. Some examples include checking multiple columns or combining multiple conditions with `AND`/`OR`.

**Example: Complex validation with custom conditions**

```python
@dlt.table
@dlt.expect("user_validity_check", "age > 18 AND transaction_amount > 0")
def complex_validation_data():
    return (
        spark.read.parquet("dbfs:/path/to/data/")
    )
```

* **`@dlt.expect("user_validity_check", "age > 18 AND transaction_amount > 0")`**: Ensures that both `age > 18` and `transaction_amount > 0` hold true simultaneously.

---

#### **4.2 Handling Data Errors and Alerts**

Handling errors and monitoring data validation is crucial in any ETL pipeline. With DLT, you can configure error handling for validation failures and set up alerts to ensure timely detection of issues.

##### **Setting Up Data Validation Error Handling in DLT**

DLT provides built-in functionality to handle errors that occur when data doesn't meet the defined expectations. If an expectation fails, the data can either be ignored, logged, or used to trigger alerts.

1. **Gracefully Handle Validation Failures**: DLT allows you to configure how to deal with rows that do not meet expectations. The default behavior is to discard the rows that violate expectations, but you can customize this behavior based on your needs.

2. **Log Errors**: You can log detailed error messages to track which rows failed validation and why.

**Example: Error handling in DLT pipelines**

```python
@dlt.table
@dlt.expect("age_is_valid", "age > 18")
def validated_data_with_error_handling():
    data = spark.read.parquet("dbfs:/path/to/raw_data/")
    
    # Handle rows where 'age' is invalid
    invalid_age_data = data.filter("age <= 18")
    invalid_age_data.write.format("delta").mode("append").save("/path/to/invalid_data/")
    
    return data.filter("age > 18")
```

* This example reads the data and validates the `age` column. Rows with invalid `age` values (i.e., less than or equal to 18) are saved into a separate Delta table (`invalid_data`) for later investigation.

---

##### **Configuring Alerts for Pipeline Failures**

You can configure alerts in Databricks to notify users when a pipeline fails or when data does not meet expectations. Alerts are configured through the Databricks UI, typically within the **Pipelines** section.

1. **Set up Alerts**: Go to the **Jobs** or **Pipelines** tab in Databricks.
2. **Add a Notification**: In the job or pipeline settings, add an alert for failures.
3. **Set Thresholds**: Configure the alert to be triggered based on specific conditions, such as when a pipeline runs into a validation error.

**Example**:

* Configure an alert to send an email notification when a pipeline fails due to an expectation violation.

---

##### **Monitoring Pipeline Performance and Data Quality**

Once the pipeline is running, monitoring its performance and data quality is crucial for long-term success. Databricks provides several ways to monitor and analyze your DLT pipelines:

1. **Pipeline Execution Metrics**: Databricks provides detailed metrics such as execution time, number of records processed, and failure rates. You can track these metrics through the **Pipelines** interface.

2. **Monitoring Table Quality**: You can monitor data quality by checking the validation statuses (i.e., whether data passed or failed the defined expectations).

**Example: Using the Databricks UI for monitoring**

* **Pipelines Tab**: Check the status of your DLT pipelines, and inspect the logs for errors or warnings.
* **Monitoring Data Validation**: View the results of data validation by examining the tables in the **Pipelines** dashboard, which shows if any rows were rejected based on the expectations.

---

### **Summary**

* **Data Expectations**: Use `@dlt.expect` to define and enforce rules on the data in Delta Live Tables.

  * Apply expectations for standard validations like non-null checks and numeric ranges.
  * Use complex expressions to validate multiple conditions.
* **Error Handling**: Handle data validation errors by filtering out invalid data or saving it to a separate location for later review.

  * Gracefully discard or log errors to avoid disrupting the pipeline.
* **Alerts and Monitoring**: Set up alerts for validation failures and monitor the performance of your pipelines in Databricks.

  * Track metrics like failure rates, execution time, and data validation results in the **Pipelines** tab.
