#### **8.1 Implementing Data Governance**

Data governance is crucial to ensure that data is accurate, accessible, and secure. In **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**, you can implement data governance in several ways, including by tagging sensitive data, maintaining data lineage, and ensuring schema consistency.

Best Practices for Using Unity Catalog to Manage Metadata Across Multiple Workspaces
Centralize Metadata: Use Unity Catalog as the central repository for all metadata, so all users and teams can access the same dataset details.

Consistent Naming Conventions: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your catalogs, schemas, and tables to make assets easier to manage.

Tagging and Classification: Use tags to classify data assets, such as sensitive, PII, or compliance-required, to help manage access and compliance requirements.


##### **8.1.1 Setting Up Data Tags for Classification**

Data classification is an essential practice for managing sensitive and personal data. By tagging data, you can label it according to its sensitivity level (e.g., **PII**, **sensitive**). Delta tables allow you to set custom tags for specific columns or rows to classify and protect sensitive information.

**Setting Up Data Tags** in Delta Live Tables:

1. **Create Tags**: You can define tags to classify your data based on sensitivity levels. This could include tags like `PII` (Personally Identifiable Information), `Sensitive`, or `Confidential`.

   Example of adding tags to columns during table creation:

   ```python
   @dlt.table
   @dlt.tag("PII", "Sensitive")
   def raw_customer_data():
       df = dlt.read("bronze_customer_data")
       return df
   ```

2. **Tagging Columns**: Tagging specific columns helps classify sensitive information like personal identification details (e.g., name, SSN, email).

3. **Tagging Tables**: You can also tag entire tables to designate the level of sensitivity for data that is being processed or stored in a specific table.

   Example:

   ```python
   @dlt.table
   @dlt.tag("Sensitive", "PII")
   def customer_data():
       df = dlt.read("bronze_customer_data")
       return df
   ```

These tags can be used to apply additional security measures (e.g., encryption) and help identify sensitive data for compliance audits.

##### **8.1.2 Implementing Data Lineage for Auditing and Compliance**

**Data lineage** refers to tracking the flow of data through the pipeline, from its source to its final destination. It is essential for auditing and compliance, as it helps organizations understand how data is transformed, who accessed it, and how it is stored.

In **Delta Live Tables**, you can automatically track the lineage of your tables using the Databricks **lineage viewer**. By setting up data lineage, you can ensure that data transformations are transparent and auditable.

To enable data lineage in DLT:

1. **Use DLT Table Decorations**: When defining tables in your pipeline, add metadata like transformations and dependencies that automatically populate the lineage viewer.

   Example:

   ```python
   @dlt.table
   def processed_data():
       df = dlt.read("raw_data")
       # Perform transformations
       df = df.filter(col("age") > 18)
       return df
   ```

2. **Viewing Data Lineage**: After running your pipeline, the **lineage** can be viewed in the Databricks UI:

   * Navigate to the **Delta Live Tables** pipeline UI.
   * Select a table or view to see its lineage, showing how data flows from source to destination and what transformations have been applied.

3. **Tracking Data Changes**: Use **Delta’s time travel features** to audit historical data and track changes over time, ensuring compliance and traceability.

   Example of time travel:

   ```python
   df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 5).load("/mnt/delta/table")
   ```

##### **8.1.3 Ensuring Schema Consistency Using `mergeSchema`**

**Schema consistency** is a critical aspect of data governance. As your data evolves, you need to ensure that the schema remains consistent and any changes are managed appropriately.

Delta Lake automatically supports **schema evolution** with the `mergeSchema` option, ensuring that new fields added to the data are incorporated into the table’s schema without breaking existing data structures.

To enable **schema evolution** in Delta Live Tables:

1. **Use `mergeSchema` for Schema Evolution**: Set the `mergeSchema` option when writing to Delta tables to automatically add new columns or update the schema.

   Example:

   ```python
   df.write.format("delta").option("mergeSchema", "true").mode("append").save("/mnt/delta/customer_data")
   ```

2. **Schema Validation**: You can validate the schema of incoming data against an existing Delta table schema to ensure that the transformations align with the table’s schema definition.

   Example:

   ```python
   @dlt.table
   def customer_data():
       df = dlt.read("raw_customer_data")
       # Validate and ensure schema consistency
       return df
   ```

#### **8.2 Row-Level Security and Data Access**

Row-level security allows you to control which data rows are accessible to different users based on their roles or attributes. This is particularly useful in multi-tenant environments where different users or groups need access to different subsets of data.

---

##### **8.2.1 Implementing Row-Level Security with Delta Tables**

In **Delta Live Tables**, row-level security can be implemented by filtering data based on user-specific attributes (e.g., user ID, region). This ensures that users only have access to the data they are authorized to see.

Example: Implementing row-level security to show data for a specific region:

1. **Define Row-Level Security Logic**:
   You can use `filter()` or `where()` in PySpark to enforce row-level security by restricting data based on conditions.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import col

   @dlt.table
   def customer_data():
       df = dlt.read("bronze_customer_data")
       # Apply row-level security: only show data for a specific region
       df = df.filter(col("region") == "North America")
       return df
   ```

2. **Dynamically Control Access**: You can apply more complex row-level security logic by dynamically filtering data based on the user or other contextual information.

Example: Restricting data based on user roles (e.g., only allowing access to specific customer data):

```python
user_role = "manager"  # Dynamic role from user context

@dlt.table
def filtered_customer_data():
    df = dlt.read("bronze_customer_data")
    if user_role == "manager":
        df = df.filter(col("region") == "North America")
    return df
```

---

##### **8.2.2 Configuring Data Access Policies and Permissions**

Managing access to Delta tables in Databricks involves setting up **fine-grained data access controls**. You can set policies and permissions to ensure that users only have access to authorized data.

* **Granting Permissions**: In Databricks, you can set table-level and column-level permissions using **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.

  Example:

  ```python
  # Grant access to a table for a specific user
  spark.sql("GRANT SELECT ON delta.`/mnt/delta/customer_data` TO `user@example.com`")
  ```

* **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Databricks supports RBAC, allowing you to assign roles (e.g., `admin`, `developer`, `reader`) to users and control access to various resources.

  Example:

  ```python
  # Assign roles to a user
  spark.sql("GRANT ROLE `reader` TO `user@example.com`")
  ```

* **Column-Level Security**: You can restrict access to specific columns in a Delta table by using **column masking**. This ensures that sensitive data (e.g., SSNs, account numbers) is only accessible by authorized users.

  Example:

  ```python
  # Masking the "ssn" column for unauthorized users
  spark.sql("SELECT name, email, mask(ssn) FROM delta.`/mnt/delta/customer_data`")
  ```

---

##### **8.2.3 Using Delta Features for Security in Multi-Tenant Environments**

In multi-tenant environments, you need to ensure that each tenant's data is isolated and secured from other tenants. You can use **Delta’s security features** to achieve this.

* **Row-Level Security**: As mentioned earlier, you can use **row-level security** to isolate tenant data within the same table by applying a tenant identifier to filter data.

* **Data Encryption**: Delta supports **encryption** to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit. You can configure Delta tables to automatically encrypt data to comply with security policies.

* **Access Control**: Use **Databricks access control** policies to ensure that each tenant can only access their own data.

Example:

```python
@dlt.table
def tenant_data():
    tenant_id = "tenant_1"  # Get tenant-specific identifier dynamically
    df = dlt.read("bronze_data")
    df = df.filter(col("tenant_id") == tenant_id)
    return df
```

You can implement tenant-specific access rules and enforce data isolation across multiple tenants.
